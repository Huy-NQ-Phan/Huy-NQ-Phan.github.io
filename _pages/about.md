Hi, I am Huy, but you can also call me Kai, my nickname. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam ![vnflag](/images/vnflag-16x16.png). I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Center for Low-Temperature Plasma Sciences](https://www.plasma.nagoya-u.ac.jp/#) at Nagoya University, Japan ![jpflag](/images/jpflag-16x16.png).

I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Inorganic Chemistry, majoring in [Chemical Engineering](https://fas.tdtu.edu.vn/en), at Ton Duc Thang University, Vietnam, in a 4.5-year program. After graduating, I briefly worked as a manufacturing technician at [First Solar](https://www.firstsolar.com/), a solar panel manufacturer. That experience ignited my passion for clean energy, leading me to pursue a Master's degree at the [Green Energy Center](https://gest.fcu.edu.tw/en/) at Feng Chia University in Taiwan ![twflag](/images/twflag-16x16.png). I graduated summa cum laude, received an outstanding excellence certificate from the university president, and became a member of the Phi Tau Phi Scholastic Honor Society. After that, I continued at FCU for my Ph.D. in [Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.fcu.edu.tw/en/), focusing on waste and wastewater treatment through electrochemical processes. Over three years, I published several papers in this field and graduated as valedictorian of my doctoral program, earning the university's outstanding excellence award.

I am passionate about research and aim to be an interdisciplinary researcher, combining chemistry and materials science to address challenges in energy and environmental sustainability. My current research interests include using electrochemical and photocatalysis methods for waste and wastewater treatment. In my postdoctoral work, I am also exploring lithium metal batteries. In addition to my core expertise, I enjoy expanding my skills in computational chemistry, academic graphic design, data analysis, and statistics, leveraging technology to enhance my research.

Outside of the lab, I love playing sports, especially soccer, and I’m also a fan of esports. I’m always eager to connect and collaborate with others who share the same vision and passion. If you would like to get in touch, feel free to leave me a message!
